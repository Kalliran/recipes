        <h2>How to Make Greek Baklava</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>What is Baklava?</h3>
            <p>Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary syrup. Pronounce "baklava" like "bah-klah-vah." The stress is placed on the first syllable.</p>

            <p>Though baklava is often associated with Greek restaurants now, its exact origins are unclear.

            Food historians think modern baklava may have been invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire, then modified in Greece. However, the technique of layering unleavened bread with nuts and honey can be traced back as far as the 8th century B.C.E. during the Assyrian Empire.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
               <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li> 
               <li>1 cup butter</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
               <li>1 cup water</li> 
               <li>1 cup white sugar</li> 
               <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
               <li>Â½ cup honey</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions step-by-step</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.</li><br>
                <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li><br>
                <li>Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.</li><br>
                <li>Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep.</li><br>
                <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li><br>
                <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool.</li><br>
                <li>Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.</li><br>
                <li>Enjoy</li>
